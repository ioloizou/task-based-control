# Task Based Control
This repository contains lab assignments completed for the Task Based Control course as part of my Master's program in Advanced Robotics at Centrale Nantes.

## Overview

The labs in this repository focus on various topics covered in the course, like Visual Servoing, ....

## Contents

- `ecn_visualservo/` - Simulated visual servoing with 2D cartesian, 2D polar and 2 1/2D
- `ecn_sensorbased/` - A QP controller for doing visual servoing with the camera and controlling the robot while respecting the joint limits
- `ecn_baxter_vs/` - Visual servoing with the baxter arm while respecting the joint limits with the weighted matrix approach

## Visuals

Below are some key visuals from the lab assignments, including plots, diagrams, or screenshots to illustrate the results and methodologies.

## How to Use

This repository is for showcasing purposes. To explore the code and reports:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioloizou/task-based-control.git
```

Feel free to browse through each lab folder to view the detailed documentation and code for each assignment. If you don't have the university VM you will not be able to run it as you will be missing many dependecies.
